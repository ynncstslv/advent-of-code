### Introduction

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels released daily during December that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other. This repository contains all my solutions, organized by year. Each year has its dedicated branch, and within each branch, the challenges are further organized by day.

### Project Structure

The structure of the project is designed for simplicity and ease of navigation. Solutions are organized by year, each residing within its dedicated branch. Within each year's branch, challenges are further organized by day, following the typical structure below:

```sql
year
|   day1
|   day2
|   day3
|   ...
|   day25
```

For each day, there is a file containing the solution logic, input files, and any additional resources required for that day's challenge.

### Usage

To run a specific solution, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the branch corresponding to the year of the solution you want to run.
2. Inside the year's branch, locate the directory for the specific day.
3. Execute the file associated with the solution.

This repository is designed to accommodate solutions in various programming languages. Whether it's Java, Go, JavaScript, TypeScript or another language, you'll need to run the solutions accordingly.

### Branches

Each year's branch is independent, allowing for easy navigation and comparison between different years. It's worth noting that I'm working in reverse chronological order, starting from 2023 and going back to 2015. The choice of programming languages may vary from year to year, as I use Advent of Code as an opportunity to learn new languages or enhance my skills in existing ones.

- **2023**: Solutions in Java for the Advent of Code challenges in the year 2023.
